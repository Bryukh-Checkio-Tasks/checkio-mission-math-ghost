    Ghosts are very unpredictable creatures.
    But is the "True" randomness is exist or we just don't know how is it defined?
    Our ghost appears every hour and has various luminescence (even with negative value).
    These values are calculated as a complex function of number (hour).
    So if we have several observations, then we can try to
    predict the next value.
</p>

<p>
    The ghost appeared ten times already.
    We writen luminescence values from 1st hour to 10th hour
    and you should try to predict the value at
    by 11th hour.
    Values are calculated as a fixed mathematics formula where
    as an argument is using a hour.
</p>
<p>
    You are given recent values as a sequence of numbers.
    You should try to predict the next value.

    This is a mission with dynamic scores and result will be calculated based on your precision.
    Tests are random - for each case we generate a formula and calculate 10 values with input value
    1, 2, ... 10. We will show you these values and compare your result with 11th value.
    For each test you can get from 0 to 100 points. Points are calculated by distance of your
    prediction and the "real" point related to difference between the minimum and maximum value.
    If the distance equal or greater by 10% of the range then you get 0 points for
    that test.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Recent values as a tuple with floats or integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The prediction as a float or an integer.

    Sometimes we can not find a real formula for physical laws, but we can solve this problem
    with another methods.
