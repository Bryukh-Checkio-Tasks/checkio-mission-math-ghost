    Ghosts are very unpredictable creatures.
    But is the "True" randomness is exist or we just don't know how is it defined?
    Our ghosts appear in various points each hour and these points are calculated
    as a complex function of number (hour). So if we have several observations, then we can try to
    predict the next point where the ghost appears.
</p>

<p>
    The ghost appear on the square with size 10 by 10 kilometres.
    We writen points where the ghost appeared from 1st hour to 10th hour
    and you should try to predict where it will appear
    by 11th hour. Coordinates are calculated as a fixed mathematics formula where
    as an argument is using a hour. Formulas for horizontal and vertical coordinates are various
    (but in theory can be the same) and the results are taken by modulus 10.
</p>
<p>
    You are given recent points where the ghost appeared as a sequence on coordinates (x,y).
    You should try to predict the next point and return a two numbers as a tuple or as a list.
    Coordinates must be from 0 (including) to 10 (excluding).<br>
    0 &le; result[0] &lt; 10<br>
    0 &le; result[1] &lt; 10<br>
</p>

<p>
    This is a mission with dynamic scores and result will be calculated based on your precision.
    Tests are random - for each case we generate a formula and calculate 10 points with input value
    1, 2, ... 10. We will show you N values and compare your result with 11th point.
    For each test you can get from 0 to 100 points. Points are calculated by distance of your
    prediction and the "real" point. If the distance equal or greater by 1 then you get 0 points for
    that test.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Recent points as a tuple of tuples with floats.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The prediction as a list or a tuple of two floats or integers.
