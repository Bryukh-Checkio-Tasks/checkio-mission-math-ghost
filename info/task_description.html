    Ghosts can be very unpredictable creatures, but do they truly embrace randomness or is it that
    we just don't understand their patterns? Our ghost appears every hour and has a varying level of
    luminescence (possibly even with a negative value) each time it appears. These values are
    calculated through a complex function based on the hour. What this means is that if we have
    several observations, we can attempt to predict the next value.
</p>

<p>
    We know that the ghost has appeared ten times already. Weâ€™ve recorded its luminescence values
    from 1st hour through the 10th hour and need to predict the value for the 11th hour. Values are
    calculated as part of a fixed mathematical formula where the argument is an hour.
</p>
<p>
    You are given the recent values as a sequence of numbers. You should try to predict the next
    value.
</p>

<p>
    This is a mission with dynamic scoring, so the results will be calculated based on your
    precision. Tests are random - for each case we generate a formula and calculate 10 values with
    input value 1, 2, ... 10. We will show you these values and compare your result to the 11th
    value. For each test you can earn anywhere from 0 to 100 points. Points are calculated using the
    difference between your prediction and the "real" point as it relates to the range of
    luminescence values. If the difference is equal or greater by 10% of the range from the smallest
    value to largest value then you get 0 points for that test.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Recent values as a tuple with floats or integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The prediction as a float or an integer.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    While there may be no physical law or property that you can calculate in this scenario, comfort
    yourself in knowing that should you ever meet a ghost, you can predict its intentions with your
    Python-fu.
